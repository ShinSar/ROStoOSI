# ROStoOSI
Generation of OSI-traces from ROSBags
ROSBags are converted into OSI traces following the ASAM OSI standard ( https://opensimulationinterface.github.io/osi-documentation/#top-osi_trace_file_formats )

Dependencies needed to run the script:
1. ROS Module installed (preferrably ros galactic) https://docs.ros.org/en/galactic/Installation.html
2. Python 3.8
3. Open-Simulation-Interface https://github.com/OpenSimulationInterface/open-simulation-interface

A sample mcap (ROSBag) file is provided for checking out the script.
